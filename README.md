# Torn Ranked War Assistant

A browser app for Torn Ranked Wars. Displays faction members and their battlestats (from FFScouter defaults) and live status (from Torn API).

## Workflow
- Faction battlestats are generated by a GitHub workflow/script and stored in `ffscouter_defaults.json`.
- User enters Torn API key; app polls Torn API for faction member status and updates the table.

## Files
- `index.html` — UI
- `js/api.js` — Torn API helpers
- `js/state.js` — app state
- `js/app.js` — UI logic
- `ffscouter_defaults.json` — battlestats
- `scripts/fetch_ffscouter_defaults.py` — battlestats generator

## Storage
- Uses `localStorage` for caching faction/player data and settings.
